# Regression with ARIMA errors

This repo contains python code to illustrate how to setup, fit and forecast using a Regression model with an ARIMA error process.  

In this model we forecast daily level data and regress on seasonal indexes representing the month and day of week.

## Extented learning task:

* Can write code that allows you to include holidays and regular special events into your model using dummy variables?

* Can you modify the model to use fourier series for monthly seasonality instead of seasonal indexes?
